"Workshop Collection 10", held in Tokyo was full of families and children to experience the latest technologies.
AgIC workshop has exhibited an installation to show what's possible with its product: conductive ink.

The installation is designed to be one of Japanese ethnic ornament "Kazaguruma", a litte windmill. Japanese ethnic pattern "Wagara" is printed with conductive ink on each mill with chip LED mouted. Sensors on the board detects human passage, and mills rotate as if wind blew on them.

We showed that flexible circuit design can easily be built and designing product can be also be flexible.
